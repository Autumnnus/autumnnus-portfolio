    "description": "I'm a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building scalable, user-centric applications. My expertise spans frontend development with React, Zustand, and TypeScript, as well as backend systems with Node.js, MongoDB, and Spring Boot.\n At my current role, I design and implement end-to-end features — from intuitive UI components to robust API services. I’ve also contributed to AI-powered modules by integrating OpenAI embeddings and Pinecone, enabling smarter search and knowledge management solutions.\n I enjoy working with clean architecture principles (SOLID, CQRS, Onion Architecture) and continuously seek to write maintainable, high-quality code. Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration and effective problem-solving within agile teams.\n Currently, I’m expanding my expertise in AI integrations and scalable backend systems while staying curious about emerging technologies.",
